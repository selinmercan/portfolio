This is a data transformation project with derivations from a local-hosted PostgreSQL instance to Snowflake using Estuary.
The transformation uses product_id as a key to indicate total quantity of a product ordered and the sales amount. The new table can then be manipulated on Snowflake to analyze customer spending patterns.
